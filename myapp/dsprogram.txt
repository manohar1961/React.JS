1.An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).
Given an array arr[] of size N, Return the index of any one of its peak elements.
Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0. 
Input: array[]= {5, 10, 20, 15}
Output: 20
Explanation: The element 20 has neighbors 10 and 15, both of them are less than 20.
2.Given an array arr[] and an integer K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.
Input:
N = 6
arr[] = 7 10 4 3 20 15
K = 3
Output : 7
Explanation :3rd smallest element in the given array is 7.

3.Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[]. Expected time complexity is O(Logn) 
Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,},   x = 2
  Output: 4 // x (or 2) occurs 4 times in arr[]

  Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,},   x = 3
  Output: 1 

  Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,},   x = 1
  Output: 2
